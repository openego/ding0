Changes
-------

Assignment of loads to generators in lv_connect_generators was made deterministic. Before this happened randomly leading to different lv_grids using the same input data. The network creation is now reproduceable while lv_branches were reinforced differently before. 
Should solve 
`#245 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/245>`_
and at least parts of 
`#40 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/40>`_.
