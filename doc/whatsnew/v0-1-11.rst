Release v0.1.11 month day, year
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Changes
-------

* Assignment of loads to generators in lv_connect_generators
  was made deterministic. Before this happened randomly leading
  to different lv_grids using the same input data. The network
  creation is now reproduceable while lv_branches were reinforced
  differently before. 
  
  Should solve 
  `#245 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/245>`_
  and at least parts of 
  `#40 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/40>`_.
* A proper sign convention (see :ref:`sign-convention-pq`)for P,Q is introduced
  `#266 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/266>`_,
  see also `PR #271 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/pull/271>`_.

* Identification of critical nodes by VDE norm AR 4105 fixed. All power flows behind
  node are taken into account now.

  Should solve `#300 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/300>`_.
