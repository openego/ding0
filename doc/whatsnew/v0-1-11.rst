Release v0.1.11 month day, year
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Changes
-------

* Assignment of loads to generators in lv_connect_generators
  was made deterministic. Before this happened randomly leading
  to different lv_grids using the same input data. The network
  creation is now reproduceable while lv_branches were reinforced
  differently before.

  Should solve
  `#245 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/245>`_
  and at least parts of
  `#40 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/40>`_.
* A proper sign convention (see :ref:`sign-convention-pq`)for P,Q is introduced
  `#266 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/266>`_,
  see also `PR #271 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/pull/271>`_.

* This release includes new tests for MV-/ as well as for LV-Grids

*  These test verify the functionality of most of the functions in '~/core/network/grids.py'
including the creation and modification of MV and LV Grids (e.g. adding generators/transformators..)
. Focus lies on the appropriate creation of the graphs and it's corresponding routings;
Test are done in grids created with oedb-extracted data and/or synthetic grids, depending on the feature to be tested.
