DIstribution Network GeneratOr (Ding0) is a tool to generate synthetic medium
and low voltage power distribution grids based on open (or at least accessible)
data.
This software project is part of the research project
`open_eGo <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com>`_.

The theoretical background is detailed in section :ref:`theoretical_background`.
Install the software package as explained :ref:`installation`. Take up on the
:ref:`ding0-examples` to understand how to use the software.

A standardized presentation of ding0 can be found in the `factsheet on the OEP <http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/factsheets/models/36/>`_.
