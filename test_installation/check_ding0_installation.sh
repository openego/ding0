# Test installation of latest ding0 version in fresh OS installation
#
# To obtain a fresh installation environment we create a virtualized OS by the help of docker
# If you haven't installed docker yet, check out install_docker.sh
#
# Note: in this script all docker commands are executed as root (via sudo) as this is required on debian (solydX) systems
#
# Execute this script from its current location (same where setup.py lives)

# make ding0 install script and dependency install script executable
chmod +x install_ding0.sh
chmod +x ding0_system_dependencies.sh

# create fresh container with ubuntu OS and run ding0_system_dependencies.sh and install_ding0.sh script within it
